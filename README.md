Health Innovators – AI-Based IVR Healthcare Triage System
📌 Project Overview

  Health Innovators is an AI-powered Interactive Voice Response (IVR) simulation system designed to efficiently triage healthcare requests.
This project is temporarily implemented as a locally running service for development and testing purposes and does not operate through real phone calls.
The system simulates IVR interactions via a local interface (CLI / local server) and classifies cases as Emergency or Non-Emergency, providing appropriate actions such as appointment booking or medical guidance.

🎯 Objectives

  --->Simulate healthcare IVR call triaging
  --->Prioritize emergency cases using AI logic
  --->Reduce manual workload through automation
  --->Validate decision-making flow in a local environment

🛠️ System Features

  --->Locally simulated IVR interaction
  --->Emergency and non-emergency classification
  --->AI-driven decision engine
  --->Token-based appointment confirmation
  --->Guided symptom and patient detail collection
  --->Fully automated decision flow (no real telephony)

📞 Interaction Flow (Local IVR Simulation)
1️⃣ System Start

  1. Display a greeting message
  2. Prompt user options:
          --->Press 1 – Emergency
          --->Press 2 – Non-Emergency

🚨 Emergency Flow (Option 1)

The system performs the following steps:
  1. Collect patient issue (text or keypad-style input)
  2. Collect personal details:
          --->Name
          --->Phone number
  3. Automatically prioritize appointment booking
  4. Confirm entered details
  5. Generate a unique token number
  6. Display and store the token for the patient
  7. End the session

🩺 Non-Emergency Flow (Option 2)

The system collects:

  1. Issue description
  2. Symptoms (preloaded list: 1–9)
  3. Age
  4. Gender:
      --->Press 1 – Male
      --->Press 2 – Female
  5. Patient Status:
      --->Press 1 – Normal
      --->Press 2 – Child
      --->Press 3 – Pregnant
  6. Medication background details

🤖 AI Decision Engine

The AI module analyzes all collected inputs and classifies the case as:
      --->Emergency
      --->Non-Emergency

(This classification is based on predefined rules or AI logic implemented for local execution.)

⚠️ If Classified as Emergency

  1. Clearly explain why the case is considered an emergency
  2. Provide options:
      --->Press 1 – Book Appointment
      --->Press 2 – End Session

  3. If booking is selected:
      --->Collect remaining details
      --->Confirm appointment
      --->End session

✅ If Classified as Non-Emergency

  1. Provide appropriate guidance or next steps
  2. Suggest self-care or follow-up recommendations
  3. End session
